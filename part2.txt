Generalization Concept Using Generics:
Generalization using Generics in C# refers to writing type-independent code that can work with different data types without rewriting the logic.
 Generics allow you to define classes, methods, or interfaces with type placeholders, enabling reusability and type safety.
 For example, a List<T> can store elements of any specified type like List<int> or List<string>. This approach avoids code duplication and reduces runtime errors by enforcing type checks during compilation.

Hierarchy Design in Real Business:
Hierarchy design in real business refers to structuring systems or classes in a layered, parent-child relationship to represent real-world roles or operations. 
For instance, in a company, employees, managers, and executives can be modeled in a hierarchy, with shared functionality in a base class and specialized behaviors in derived classes. 
This design promotes scalability, code reusability, and reflects the organization's structure, making systems easier to extend and maintain.
